    "Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods in Python that have double underscores both before and after their names. They are also known as \"magic methods\" or \"special methods\". Dunder methods are used to define how instances of a class behave in certain situations, such as when they are created, compared, or printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common dunder methods in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``__init__(self, args...):`` This method is called when an object is created from a class, and is used to initialize its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``__str__(self):`` is used to convert an object to a string. It is called when the str() function is called on the object, or when the object is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``__repr__(self):`` is used to represent the object in a string that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``__eq__(self, other):`` This method is used to compare two objects for equality. It is called when the == operator is used on the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``__lt__(self, other):`` This method is used to compare two objects for less than. It is called when the < operator is used on the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Refer to the official Python documentation for more methods: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html"
